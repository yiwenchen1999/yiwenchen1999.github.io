    title: "HouseCrafter: Lifting Floorplans to 3D Scenes with 2D Diffusion Models"
    authors: "Yiwen Chen, Hieu T. Nguyen, Vikram Voleti, Varun Jampani, Huaizu Jiang"
    excerpt: "Created a diffusion model that lifts a 2D floorplan into a complete house-scale 3D indoor scene by autoregressively generating consistent RGB-D views at sampled camera locations. Designed a floorplan-aware attention mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across all generated views and support high-quality 3D reconstruction."

    authors: "Rao Fu, Xiao Zhan, Yiwen Chen, Daniel Ritchie, Srinath Sridhar"
    excerpt: "Worked as part of group to design a recursive 3D generator that evolves a shape as new text phrases are provided sequentially, which enabled interactive 3D modeling conditioned on natural language without retraining."

I am Yiwen Chen (陈逸文), a second-year Ph.D. student at [Khoury College of Computer Science, Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/).I received my Bachelor's degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China，and my Master's degree from Brown University . My research interests mainly focus on generation and interaction with 3D scenes and objects.
