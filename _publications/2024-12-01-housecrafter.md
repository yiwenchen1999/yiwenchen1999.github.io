title: "HouseCrafter: Lifting Floorplans to 3D Scenes with 2D Diffusion Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-12-01-housecrafter
excerpt: 'Created a diffusion model that lifts a 2D floorplan into a complete house-scale 3D indoor scene by autoregressively generating consistent RGB-D views at sampled camera locations. Designed a floorplan-aware attention mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across all generated views and support high-quality 3D reconstruction. Validated on 3D-Front with ablation studies demonstrating robustness of design choices.'
